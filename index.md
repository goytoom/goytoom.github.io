## About Me 
I am social psychologist with a strong engineering background. Prior to joining the University of Southern California, 
I completed a  BS and MS in Process Engineering at the Berlin Institute of Technology. 
Originally, I was interested in using machine learning for control systems and process optimization, 
but I became increasingly interested in using these methods to model human behavior instead. 
I then completed a BS in psychology at Free University Berlin, and transitioned to
studying complex human interactions through a combination of computational and behavioral methods. 
Currently, my research focuses on grounding computational methods in psychological theory to advance our knowledge of various social phenomena. 

## Research Interests

- **Computational Social Dynamics:** Using simulations and computational models to uncover mechanisms of group behavior and generate insights that inform both theory and applications.  
- **Psychologically Informed AI:** Leveraging psychological theories of cognition and social behavior to build AI systems that are more robust, flexible, and higher-performing.  
- **Theory-Grounded Methods & Applications:** Developing approaches that are rooted in psychological theory, ensuring interpretability, robustness, and enduring relevance across contexts.  
- **Morality and Social Behavior:** Understanding how moral values shape consequential behaviors in digital environments and beyond, including conflict, cooperation, and well-being.  

## Research Methods

- **Computational Modeling & Simulation:** Multi-agent and agent-based modeling to test psychological theories and explore emergent dynamics of social systems.
- **Machine Learning & AI Systems:** Applying ML to study human behavior and social phenomena, and to improve AI systems using psychological insights.  
- **Natural Language Processing:** Using NLP to extract psychological signals from text to study human concepts, opinions, and social behavior.  
- **Experiments & Surveys:** Designing behavioral and survey studies to validate insights from computational models and extend psychological theory.
- **Advanced Statistical Methods:** Employing Bayesian multilevel and other robust modeling techniques for generalizable and interpretable findings.

## Current Projects 
- **Testing Psychological Theories with Generative Agents:** Using multi-agent simulations and LLMs to model social dynamics and evaluate psychological theories.  
- **Moral Values and Decision-Making:** Investigating how context, categorization, and representations, and reward-based learning shape moral judgments and social behavior.  
- **Status and Norms in Online Platforms:** Studying when groups punish or reward norm violations such as aggression and incivility, and how these dynamics influence online discourse.  

## Past Projects

- **Social Inferences in Language Models:** Comparing small encoder-based models (e.g., BERT) and large generative models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) in their ability to make social inferences from psychological questionnaires. Generative models were more accurate but also more biased and less transparent, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy, bias, and interpretability.  

- **Explaining Explainability:** Advocating for interpretable machine learning in the behavioral sciences by clarifying misconceptions about “black box” models. We demonstrate that interpretability can coexist with predictive accuracy and that post hoc explanations can advance both prediction and understanding of complex behavior.
