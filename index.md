## About Me 

I am social psychologist with a strong engineering background. Prior to joining the University of Southern California, 
I completed a  BS and MS in Process Engineering at the Berlin Institute of Technology. 
Originally, I was interested in using machine learning for control systems and process optimization, 
but I became increasingly interested in using these methods to model human behavior instead. 
I then completed a BS in psychology at Free University Berlin, and transitioned to
studying complex human interactions through a combination of computational and behavioral methods. 
Currently, my research focuses on grounding computational methods in psychological theory to advance our knowledge of various social phenomena. 

## Research Interests 

- **Morality, Values, and Pro-social Behavior:** How do humans conceptualize moral values and how do they guide our behavior, good or bad?
- **Online & Social Media Behavior:** What insights does online behavior across various contexts provide about hate, conflicts, as well as mental health & well-being? 
- **Theory-Driven Computational Models:** How can we place top-down, theory-driven constraints on computational methods to increase interpretability and robustness? 

## Research Methods 
- **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning to explore untapped information sources and facilitate novel insights about social phenomena.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Applying NLP to extract psychological information from textual data. Critically examine what language models can tell us about human psychology. 
- **Agent-based Models:** Simulating large-scale social interactions to elucidate the underlying dynamics of moral behaviors and use these insights to facilitate pro-social behavior. 
- **Bayesian Multilevel Models:** Applying advaced modeling techniques to generate more robust and generalizable research findings.

## Papers in preparation & under review 
- **Targeting Audiences' Moral Values Shapes Misinformation Sharing:** We analyze how moral framing increases dissemination of online misinformation and its potential for
targeted misinformation campaigns. We combine large-scale social media analyses with behavioral experiments and find that matched moral framing in line with individuals'
 moral values increases its spread independent of message veracity, familiarity or believability. 
- **Perils and Opportunities in Using Large Language Models in Psychological Research**: 
We review and conduct a comprehensive analysis of both the benefits and risks associated with using LLMs in psychological research and 
advocate for the development of reliable applications and the use of open, interpretable models. We also quantify, and warn against, cultural biases of LLMs. 
A more inclusive approach is critical to ensuring reproducible, generalizable, and unbiased scientific insights, when employing LLMs to study the human mind. 
- **Contextual Moral Values and Categorization:** We propose a novel framework that emphasizes the role of representations and categorization for moral values.
In this framework, individuals hold distinct notions of right and wrong, with real-life scenarios contextually mapping onto these representations as exemplars (e.g., via perception of prototypicality) or through associated features (e.g., perceived harm). 
Through multiple empirical studies, we investigate the interplay between context, moral judgments, and value representations in the brain, offering theory-informed insights into vital moral topics. 
By embracing context and a representation lens, we enhance the scope of context-sensitive moral psychology research and facilitate the integration of diverse moral theories. 
- **Social inferences in language models:** We investigate the social inferences from responses to psychological questionnaires in small fine-tuned encoder-based language models (e.g., BERT) and large generative language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
Our comparison with human raters reveals that generative models stand out in accuracy but show more biases and are less transparent than smaller models. 
We further find that addressing biases in LLMs benefits from few-shot prompting and targeted fine-tuning, underscoring the trade-offs between accuracy, bias, and transparency in applying language models to social inference tasks.
- **Counter-normative status conferral on social media platform:** We combine large-scale social media analysis with behavioral experiments to investigate how and when groups punish or reward norm-violations, such as aggression and incivility. 
We find that groups punish norm-violations when perceiving the outgroup as non-aggressive and reward it when feeling attacked. Our results underline past work on tit-for-tat cycles of incivility 
and show that group dynamics, which  reward commitment to and defense of the group, contribute to the quick deterioration of online discourse and the rapid spread of toxicity.
