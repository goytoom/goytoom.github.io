## About Me 
I am social psychologist with a strong engineering background. Prior to joining the University of Southern California, 
I completed a  BS and MS in Process Engineering at the Berlin Institute of Technology. 
Originally, I was interested in using machine learning for control systems and process optimization, 
but I became increasingly interested in using these methods to model human behavior instead. 
I then completed a BS in psychology at Free University Berlin, and transitioned to
studying complex human interactions through a combination of computational and behavioral methods. 
Currently, my research focuses on grounding computational methods in psychological theory to advance our knowledge of various social phenomena. 

## Research Interests

- **Computational Social Dynamics:** Using simulations and computational models to study group conflict, cooperation, bias, and other emergent social behaviors.
- **Psychologically Informed AI:** Leveraging psychological theories of cognition and behavior to design more adaptive, socially aware, and human-centered AI systems.
- **Theory–Method Integration:** Developing frameworks that connect psychological theory with computational approaches, ensuring relevance across shifting AI paradigms.
- **Misinformation, Morality, and Online Behavior:** Understanding how moral values, persuasion, and digital environments shape communication, conflict, and well-being.

## Research Methods

- **Computational Modeling & Simulation:** Multi-agent and agent-based modeling to test psychological theories and explore emergent dynamics of social systems.
- **Machine Learning & AI Systems:** Applying and adapting ML methods to study behavior, and embedding psychological principles to improve AI reasoning and decision-making.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Extracting social and psychological signals from large-scale text data to analyze communication, persuasion, and online interaction.
- **Experiments & Surveys:** Designing behavioral and survey studies to validate insights from computational models and extend psychological theory.
- **Advanced Statistical Methods:** Employing Bayesian multilevel and other robust modeling techniques for generalizable and interpretable findings.

## Current Projects 
- **Testing Psychological Theories With Generative Agents:** We combine LLMs with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to study social dynamics and test psychological theories. 
Our multi-agent LLM approach enables the simulation of social dynamics without restrictive top-down assumptions while also allowing to manipulate environmental and participant variables that cannot be changed in human samples.
These simulation can help establish causal relationships, test boundary conditions, facilitate novel hypotheses, and compare the predictive validity of competing theories.
- **Contextual Moral Values and Categorization:** We investigate the role of representations and categorization for moral decision-making, focusing on the interplay between context, 
moral judgments, and value representations in the brain, offering theory-informed insights into vital moral topics. 
By embracing a context and a representation lens, we enhance the scope of context-sensitive moral psychology research and facilitate the integration of diverse moral theories. 
- **Counter-normative status conferral on social media platform:** We combine large-scale social media analysis with behavioral experiments to investigate how and when groups punish or reward norm-violations, such as aggression and incivility. 
We find that groups punish norm-violations when perceiving the outgroup as non-aggressive and reward it when feeling attacked. Our results underline past work on tit-for-tat cycles of incivility 
and show that group dynamics, which  reward commitment to and defense of the group, contribute to the quick deterioration of online discourse and the rapid spread of toxicity. 

## Past Projects

- **Social inferences in language models:** We investigate the social inferences from responses to psychological questionnaires in small fine-tuned encoder-based language models (e.g., BERT) and large generative language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
Our comparison with human raters reveals that generative models stand out in accuracy but show more biases and are less transparent than smaller models. 
We further find that addressing biases in LLMs benefits from few-shot prompting and targeted fine-tuning, underscoring the trade-offs between accuracy, bias, and transparency in applying language models to social inference tasks.

- **Explaining Explainability: Interpretable machine learning for the behavioral sciences:** We advocate for the adoption of interpretable Machine Learning (ML) techniques in behavioral sciences,
dispelling misconceptions that ML models are 'black boxes' and unsuitable for inference. By highlighting the nuanced nature of model interpretability, 
the compatibility of interpretability with predictive accuracy, and the potential of post hoc explanations, we encourage the use of ML models to both predict and understand complex behavioral phenomena.
