<!-- ## About Me -->
<!--  -->
<!-- I am social psychologist with a strong engineering background. Prior to joining the University of Southern California, -->
<!-- I completed a  BS and MS in Process Engineering at the Berlin Institute of Technology. -->
<!-- Originally, I was interested in using machine learning for control systems and process optimization, -->
<!-- but I became increasingly interested in using these methods to model human behavior instead. -->
<!-- I then completed a BS in psychology at Free University Berlin, focusing on applying computational methods in social psychology and -->
<!-- transitioned to studying complex human interactions through a combination of various computational and behavioral methods. -->
<!-- Currently, my research focuses on grounding computational methods in psychological theory to advance our knowledge of various social phenomena. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Research Interests -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - **Morality & Values, Pro-social Behavior:** How do humans conceptualize moral values and how do they guide our behavior, positive or negative? -->
<!-- - **Cross-cultural differences:** How does human psychology differ across cultures and how does this lead to bias, prejudice, and conflicts? -->
<!-- - **Theory-Driven Computational Models:** How can we place top-down, theory-driven constraints on computational methods to increase interpretability and robustness of research outcomes? -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Research Methods -->
<!-- - **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning to access new sources of information and to facilitate robust inferences about social phenomena. -->
<!-- - **Natural Language Processing:** Apply NLP to extract psychological information from textual data. Critically examine what language models can tell us about human psychology. -->
<!-- - **Agent-based Models:** Simulate large-scale social interactions to elucidate the underlying dynamics of moral behaviors. Can these insights help to facilitate pro-social behavior? -->
<!-- - **Bayesian Multilevel Models:** Apply advaced modeling techniques to generate more robust and generalizable research findings. -->

<!-- ## Current Projects -->
<!-- - **Moral Framing Drives Misinformation Spread on Social Media:** We analyze how misinformation can exploit moral framing to increase spread on misinformation -->
<!-- and to what extent this mechanism could be exploited for targeted misinformation campaigns. We combine large-scale social media analyses with rigorous behavioral experiments and find that matched moral framing, -->
<!-- that is moral framing in line with and individuals' or groups' moral values, increases its spread online and in the lab independent of message veracity, familiarity or believability. -->
<!-- - **Opportunities, Perils, and Misperceptions in Using Large Language Models in Psychological Research**: We conduct  an in-depth assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in psychological research, -->
<!-- exploring their increasing use as human participant substitutes and all-purpose text-analysis tools. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical tests, we uncover significant concerns. -->
<!-- Popular LLMs' inherent complexity, limited interpretability, and proprietary nature pose challenges to accessibility and transparency. Across a range of tests, LLMs perform worse than small(er) language models -->
<!-- and even theory-based, interpretable methods. At the same time LLMs show significantly higher demographic biases while being less robust and less reproducible. -->
<!-- We emphasize the need for a balanced approach, harnessing LLMs' potential while being mindful of these issues, ultimately striving to enhance the quality and inclusivity of psychological science. -->
<!-- - **Contextual Moral Values Through Latent Moral Representations:** We propose a framework that emphasizes the role of representations in understanding moral values and their underlying neural processes. -->
<!-- In this framework, individuals hold distinct notions of right and wrong, with real-life scenarios contextually mapping onto these representations as exemplars (e.g., via perception of prototypicality) or through associated features (e.g., perceived harm). -->
<!-- Through empirical studies, we uncover the intricate interplay between context, moral judgments, and intrinsic value representations in the brain, offering theory-informed insights into vital moral topics. -->
<!-- By embracing context and a representation lens, we enhance the scope of moral psychology research, deepening our grasp of context-sensitive moral judgments, and facilitateg the integration of diverse moral theories -->
<!-- - **Using semantic representations to facilitate survey based research:** We combine semantic representations (embeddings) of survey items with machine learning to create reliable and highly predictive short scales from full scales -->
<!-- by identifying the most predictive items from the full scale and optimizing the number of items in the short scale. Additionally, our approach enhances data quality by predicting responses to full scales from short scales, -->
<!-- and is even capable of predicting important psychological variables related to well-being and mental health. We further explore the use of generative models for generating items in both short and long scales. -->
<!-- Validation demonstrates that current large language models can successfully produce novel items for our research pipeline. -->
<!-- - **Social inferences in language models:** We conduct an in-depth analysis of social inferences in both small and large language models, such as BERT, GPT3, and GPT4. -->
<!-- By inferring the psychometrics of human targets based on their responses to various psychological survey items (e.g., personality, morality, cognition, emotion), -->
<!-- we assess the models' capability across diverse surveys and non-classical questionnaire structures. We further investigate biases in the models' inferences, focusing on specific demographics that may be inaccurately represented. -->
<!-- Finally, we compare language models to human raters, examining differences in inferences, identifying challenges faced by the models (e.g., contradictory responses, stereotypes), and understanding how humans handle such challenges. -->
<!-- - **Counter-normative status conferral on social media platform:** We combine large-scale social media analysis with behavioral experiments to investigate how and when groups punish or reward norm-violations. -->
<!-- Specifically, we analyze whether groups reward social-norm violations, such as incivility and aggression, when attacked by outgroup members and contrast this to their reaction during non-aggressive outgroup interaction. -->
<!-- We find that groups punish norm-violations when perceiving the outgroup as non-aggressive and reward it when feeling attacked. -->
<!-- Our results underline past work on tit-for-tat cycles of incivility as well as group dynamics rewarding commitment to and defense of the group, elucidating the quick deterioration of online discourse and the rapid spread of toxicity. -->
