## About Me
I am a social psychologist with a strong engineering background. 
I first worked on applying machine learning to control systems and process optimization (BS/MS Process Engineering, TU Berlin), 
but became increasingly interested in using these methods to study human behavior. 
This led me to pursue psychology (BS, Free University Berlin; PhD, University of Southern California).  
My research now combines computational and behavioral methods to study complex social phenomena, with a focus on grounding computational models in psychological theory. 
More recently, I have extended this work to improving AI systems by incorporating psychological theories of cognition and social behavior, particularly in the design of agentic AI.   

## Research Interests

- **Computational Social Dynamics:** Using simulations and computational models to uncover mechanisms of group behavior and generate insights that inform both theory and applications.  
- **Psychologically Informed AI:** Leveraging psychological theories of cognition and social behavior to build AI systems that are more robust, flexible, and higher-performing.  
- **Theory-Grounded Methods & Applications:** Developing approaches rooted in psychological theory to ensure interpretability, robustness, and relevance across contexts.  
- **Morality and Social Behavior:** Understanding how moral values shape consequential behaviors in digital environments and beyond, including conflict, cooperation, and well-being.  

## Research Methods

- **Computational Modeling & Simulation:** Multi-agent and agent-based modeling to test psychological theories and explore emergent dynamics of social systems.
- **Machine Learning & AI Systems:** Applying ML to study human behavior and social phenomena, and to improve AI systems using psychological insights.  
- **Natural Language Processing:** Using NLP to extract psychological signals from text to study human concepts, opinions, and social behavior.  
- **Experiments & Surveys:** Designing behavioral and survey studies to validate insights from computational models and extend psychological theory.
- **Advanced Statistical Methods:** Employing Bayesian multilevel and other robust modeling techniques for generalizable and interpretable findings.

## Current Projects 
- **Testing Psychological Theories with Generative Agents:** Using multi-agent simulations and LLMs to model social dynamics and evaluate psychological theories.  
- **Moral Values and Decision-Making:** Investigating how context, categorization, and representations, and reward-based learning shape moral judgments and social behavior.  
- **Status and Norms in Online Platforms:** Studying when groups punish or reward norm violations such as aggression and incivility, and how these dynamics influence online discourse.  

## Past Projects

- **Social Inferences in Language Models:** Comparing small encoder-based models (e.g., BERT) and large generative models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) in their ability to make social inferences from psychological questionnaires. Generative models were more accurate but also more biased and less transparent, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy, bias, and interpretability.  

- **Explaining Explainability:** Advocating for interpretable machine learning in the behavioral sciences by clarifying misconceptions about “black box” models. We demonstrate that interpretability can coexist with predictive accuracy and that post hoc explanations can advance both prediction and understanding of complex behavior.
