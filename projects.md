## Current Projects
- **Moral Framing Drives Misinformation Spread on Social Media:** We analyze how misinformation can exploit moral framing to increase spread on misinformation 
and to what extent this mechanism could be exploited for targeted misinformation campaigns. We combine large-scale social media analyses with rigorous behavioral experiments and find that matched moral framing, 
that is moral framing in line with and individuals' or groups' moral values, increases its spread online and in the lab independent of message veracity, familiarity or believability.
- **Contextual Moral Values Through Latent Moral Representations:** We propose a framework that emphasizes the role of representations in understanding moral values and their underlying neural processes.
In this framework, individuals hold distinct notions of right and wrong, with real-life scenarios contextually mapping onto these representations as exemplars (e.g., via perception of prototypicality) or through associated features (e.g., perceived harm). 
Through empirical studies, we uncover the intricate interplay between context, moral judgments, and intrinsic value representations in the brain, offering theory-informed insights into vital moral topics.
By embracing context and a representation lens, we enhance the scope of moral psychology research, deepening our grasp of context-sensitive moral judgments, and facilitateg the integration of diverse moral theories
- **Social inferences in language models:** We conduct an in-depth analysis of social inferences in both small and large language models, such as BERT, GPT3, and GPT4. 
By inferring the psychometrics of human targets based on their responses to various psychological survey items (e.g., personality, morality, cognition, emotion), 
we assess the models' capability across diverse surveys and non-classical questionnaire structures. We further investigate biases in the models' inferences, focusing on specific demographics that may be inaccurately represented. 
Finally, we compare language models to human raters, examining differences in inferences, identifying challenges faced by the models (e.g., contradictory responses, stereotypes), and understanding how humans handle such challenges.
- **Counter-normative status conferral on social media platform:** We combine large-scale social media analysis with behavioral experiments to investigate how and when groups punish or reward norm-violations. 
Specifically, we analyze whether groups reward social-norm violations, such as incivility and aggression, when attacked by outgroup members and contrast this to their reaction during non-aggressive outgroup interaction. 
We find that groups punish norm-violations when perceiving the outgroup as non-aggressive and reward it when feeling attacked. 
Our results underline past work on tit-for-tat cycles of incivility as well as group dynamics rewarding commitment to and defense of the group, elucidating the quick deterioration of online discourse and the rapid spread of toxicity.
