## About Me

I am social psychologist with a strong engineering background. Prior to joining the University of Southern California, 
I completed a  BS and MS in Process Engineering at the Berlin Institute of Technology. 
Originally, I was interested in using machine learning for control systems and process optimization, 
but I became increasingly interested in using these methods to model human behavior instead. 
I then completed a BS in psychology at Free University Berlin, focusing on applying computational methods in social psychology and
transitioned to studying complex human interactions through a combination of various computational and behavioral methods. 
Currently, my research focuses on grounding computational methods in psychological theory to advance our knowledge of various social phenomena.

## Research Interests

- **Theory-Driven Computational Models:** How can we place top-down, theory-driven constraints on computational methods to increase interpretability and robustness of research outcomes?
- **Morality & Values, Pro-social Behavior:** How do humans conceptualize moral values and how do they guide our behavior, positive or negative?
- **Cross-cultural differences:** How does human psychology differ across cultures and how does this lead to bias, prejudice, and conflicts?

## Research Methods
- **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning to access new sources of information and to facilitate robust inferences about social phenomena.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Apply NLP to extract psychological information from textual data. Critically examine what language models can tell us about human psychology.
- **Agent-based Models:** Simulate large-scale social interactions to elucidate the underlying dynamics of moral behaviors. Can these insights help to facilitate pro-social behavior?
- **Bayesian Multilevel Models:** Apply advanced modeling techniques to generate more robust and generalizable research findings.
